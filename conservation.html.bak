        <p>
         Various kinds of work are carried out in India in order to protect bird species.

          <h2>Research and monitoring</h2>
          <p>
            An essential part of bird conservation is monitoring and recording 
            information about the species such as their numbers, breeding habits, etc. 
        
          </p>
          <p>
            Scientific research may be carried out to determine whether a species is 
            in decline and how to address the problem.

          <h2>Habitat protection</h2>
          <p>
            The destruction of habitat is a serious threat to many birds and 
            therefore protecting habitats is crucial to protecting the species.
          </p>
          
          <p>One example of this is the preservation of wetlands in India.</p>

          <h4>Control invasive plants and animals</h4>
          <p>
            Mink and rats are a predator that threaten many bird species, 
            for example by eating their eggs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rhododendron is an example of an invasive plant which can very quickly
            take over large areas of countryside, disrupting the biodiversity.
