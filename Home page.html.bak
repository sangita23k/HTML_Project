	    <p id="myCoolText">
		Bird conservation is a field in the science of conservation biology related to threatened birds. Humans have had a profound effect on many bird species. Over one hundred species have gone extinct in historical times, although the most dramatic human-caused extinctions occurred in the Pacific Ocean as humans colonised the islands of Melanesia, Polynesia and Micronesia, during which an estimated 750â€“1800 species of bird became extinct.</p>
		<h4> Why Bird Extincts</h4>
		<p id="myCoolText"> 1 The biggest cited reason surrounds habitat loss.</p>
		<br> 2 Other threats include overhunting, accidental mortality due to structural collisions, long-line fishing bycatch, pollution, competition and predation by pet cats</br>
		<p id="myCoolText"> 3 oil spills and pesticide use and climate change. Governments, along with numerous conservation charities, work to protect birds in various ways, including legislation, preserving and restoring bird habitat, and establishing captive populations for reintroductions.</p>
